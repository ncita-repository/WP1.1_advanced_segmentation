# WP1.1_advanced_segmentation

### NCITA repository Work Package 1.1: XNAT-OHIF viewer - Advanced segmentation incorporating AI

Specific repositories and projects of the form WP1.x-y are for specific second-level work packages in the NCITA repository strategy.

This workpackage is initially aimed at the incorporation of the NVIDIA Clara tools within XNAT, extending work on the demonstration produced by a collaboration of NVIDIA, WashU, NCITA and others at RSNA in 2019. 

The NCITA repository site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear!
